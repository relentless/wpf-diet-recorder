I'm on a diet and I want to learn WPF.  And so, presenting... The WPF Diet Recorder!

Every week I record a couple of things (weight, some key measurements, what excercise I've done etc) in Excel.  This app will take the place of Excel once and for all, in all it's WPF glory!

I've implemented this using the MVVM pattern (Model-View-ViewModel), so if you'd like to see a simple end-to-end sample of how that works, take a look.

It uses an Object Database in the back end, Versant's DB4O, which is very simple to use for a project like this so it turned out well I think.

I've put up a blog post which has a little more info on it:

Enjoy!
